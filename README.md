# Team-profile-generator

For this assignmnet, we had to generate a team profe using node and OOP. The user will run node in terminal and be giver a list of question depending on manager, enginner, the intern and a none option to stop it from running after they have finnished answering the questions. 
Once, they're done with the questions, then the answers will automaticall generate in the team.html file where the user can open in it live server and see the generated card answers based on what they answered.

Kindly find attached a screen shot of the app
