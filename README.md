# Team-profile-generator

For this assignmentt, we had to generate a team profile generator using node and OOP. The user will run node in terminal and be given a list of questions depending on manager, enginner, the intern and a none option to stop it from running after they have finnished answering the questions. 
Once they're done with the questions, then the answers will automatically generate in the team.html file where the user can open in it in live server and see the generated card answers based on what they answered.

Kindly find attached a screen shot of the app
